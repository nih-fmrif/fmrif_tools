Welcome to FMRIF Tools's documentation!
=======================================

************
Introduction
************

    The **fmrif_tools** package contains a set of python utilities to aid in the processing and manipulation of scanner
    data stored in the Gold and Oxygen archive systems at the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility (FMRIF) at
    the National Institutes of Health. The utilities run under either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.5+.

    Current utilities:
        * **oxy2bids** - A utility to convert DICOM scans downloaded from Gold and Oxygen into a BIDS compatible directory
          directory structure

    For more information, or assistance, contact the lead developer at:

************
Installation
************

==============
Pre-requisites
==============
    #. For the **oxy2bids** utility, **dcm2niix** must be installed and accessible in the system's PATH variable. See
       https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage for installation instructions.
    #. **Python 2.7+** or **Python 3.5+** - I recommend installing **Anaconda**, as this will also include a way to
       manage virtual environments to prevent python packages from polluting the system-wide Python installation. See
       https://www.continuum.io/downloads for download and installation instructions. **The rest of this guide assumes
       you are using Anaconda's Python installation, although other setups (e.g. via virtualenv) are possible.**
    #. **git** - Needed for pip to extract the package contents from Github. See https://git-scm.com/downloads for download
       and installation instructions.


=====
Setup
=====

    #. If a suitable virtual environment has not been created, create one. For this example we'll call our environment **fmrif_tools**:
           ``conda create -n fmrif_tools python=3 -y``
    #. Activate the virtual environment created in the step above:
           ``source activate fmrif_tools``
    #. Install the fmrif_tools package from github:
           ``pip install git+https://github.com/nih-fmrif/fmrif_tools.git``
    #. The utility is now ready to use from the command line (or terminal), e.g.,
          ``oxy2bids [options] ...``
    #. To exit the virtual environment once you are done using the utility, type
          ``source deactivate``

    * To use re-activate the virtual environment to use in a later session, simply type,
          ``source activate <virtual environment name>``

      as in step 2 above. The package should be ready to use again.

Usage

-----
Flags
-----

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option 1 (Recommended) - Generate a BIDS mapping file, manually inspect it and correct it, then generate BIDS tree based on generated map
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option 2 - Pass in a pre-generated BIDS mapping file, generate the BIDS tree based on the given mapping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option 3 (Not Recommended) - Assume BIDS mapping generated by oxy2bids will be correct, generate the BIDS tree based on it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Usage
==============

----------------------------------------
Query DICOM datasets for custom keywords
