<h3>FMRIF TOOLS</h3>

The **fmrif_tools** package contains a set of python utilities to aid in the processing and manipulation of scanner

the National Institutes of Health. The utilities run under either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.5+.

<h4>Current utilities:</h4>
* **oxy2bids** - A utility to convert DICOM scans downloaded from Gold and Oxygen into a BIDS compatible directory
  directory structure
* **biounpack** (**Coming Soon**) - A utility to extract physiological recording data from biopack files and save it
  as independent respiratory, cardiac, and trigger 1D data files.
